Robert Beall (c. 1836 – 8 January 1892) was an English sculptor, marble merchant and monumental mason, with a stoneyard and workshop in Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne and Wear. He executed decorative fonts, reredoses and a baptistry screen in various churches, besides monuments and memorials for graveyards, and for three Grade I listed church interiors. 
Beall established his workshop in 1861 adjacent to High Level Bridge in Newcastle. Within ten years he was employing fifty-four men, sixteen boys and four women. His company became a business legacy. Beall apprenticed his son Robert Eusebius Beall, who took over the company after his death. Thereafter, the company continued under the name of Robert Beall until the 1930s. Beall's was known for erecting war memorials in the 1920s.
