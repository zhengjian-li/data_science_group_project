Granville Wellington Carter NA, Fellow National Sculpture Society (November 18, 1920 â€“ November 21, 1992) was an American sculptor.
He started his sculpture career by taking up wood carving as a teenager.  Many of his wood carved creations would be signed "Dany", as he was known by family and friends. His fine wood carvings gained him praise and coverage in local newspapers such as the "Portland Sunday Telegram"., and the "Lewistion Journal". Carter was featured the 1949 book "Handicrafts of New England," by Allen Eaton.
Dany Carter was a prolific whittler of figures and animals. All  were executed in his wood of choice - white pine. He also crafted several dioramas, some were scenes from Disney's "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)," and "Pinocchio."  Other dioramas included practical lighting effects incorporated into the settings giving them their own dramatic lighting effects.
One of his largest carvings titled "Under the Wire," can be viewed at the "Harness Racing Museum & Hall of Fame", Goshen, New York. The diorama was donated in 1972 by noted businessman and philanthropist, Louis Resnick.  The  4 ft wood harness racing diorama depicts a harrowing scene where a driver is thrown from his sulky, as three trailing sulkies are bearing down on the displaced driver.
