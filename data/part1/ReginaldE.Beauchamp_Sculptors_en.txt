Reginald E. Beauchamp (December 8, 1910 â€“ December 20, 2000) was an American sculptor whose works include Penny Franklin (1971), Whispering Bells of Freedom (1976), and a bust of Connie Mack that sits in the Baseball Hall of Fame.
Born in London, Beauchamp immigrated to the United States at age 2 with his family, who lived for five years in Rensselaer, New York, before settling in Philadelphia. He worked as the director of special events and then the head of public relations and personnel at the Philadelphia Bulletin newspaper from 1945 to 1975. He was also involved in various community groups, including Rotary International, the Philadelphia Sketch Club, the Poor Richard Club, and the Philadelphia Public Relations Association, which named him the first member of its hall of fame in 1972.
