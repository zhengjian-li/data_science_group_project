Petah Coyne (born 1953) is a contemporary American sculptor and photographer best known for her large and small scale hanging sculptures and floor installations. Working in innovative and disparate materials, her media has ranged from the organic to the ephemeral, from incorporating dead fish, mud, sticks, hay, hair, black sand, specially-formulated and patented wax, satin ribbons, silk flowers, to more recently, velvet, taxidermy, and cast wax statuary. Coyne's sculptures and photographs have been the subject of more than 30 solo museum exhibitions. 
Her work is in numerous permanent museum collections, including the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Brooklyn Museum of Art, the Denver Art Museum, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the Smithsonian Institution, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art, Kiasma in Finland, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, Musée d'art contemporain de Montréal, the Toledo Museum of Art, the High Museum of Art, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, and the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University.
