Edward Marshall Boehm (August 21, 1913 â€“ January 29, 1969) was an American figurative expressionist sculptor, known for his porcelain figures of birds and other wildlife. Boehm explained his choice of porcelain as the medium for his art as follows:"Porcelain is a permanent creation. If properly processed and fired, its colors will never change; and it can be subjected to extreme temperatures without damage. It is a medium in which one can portray the everlasting beauty of form and color of wildlife and nature." He and his wife founded an eponymous company, E.M. Boehm Studios, in 1950.
