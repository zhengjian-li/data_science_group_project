Kenneth Christopher McKinstry (February 12, 1967 â€“ January 23, 2006) was a researcher in artificial intelligence. He led the development of the MISTIC project which was launched in May 1996.  He founded the Mindpixel project in July 2000, and closed it in December 2005. McKinstry's AI work and similar early death dovetailed with another contemporary AI researcher, Push Singh and his MIT Open Mind Common Sense Project.
