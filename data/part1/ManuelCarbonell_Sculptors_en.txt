Manuel Carbonell (October 25, 1918 – November 10, 2011) was a Cuban Contemporary and Modern artist, regarded as among the greatest Cuban sculptors of his generation.  He was part of the generation of Cuban artists that includes Wifredo Lam and Agustín Cárdenas, that studied at the Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes "San Alejandro", Havana, Cuba.  Carbonell's inexhaustible vision and his ever-changing style is the product of a brilliant talent with an academic background.  Ceaselessly searching for the essence of form and the absence of details, he empowered a sense of strength and monumentality to his work.  Until the age of 92, he had continued to work daily in his studio.
