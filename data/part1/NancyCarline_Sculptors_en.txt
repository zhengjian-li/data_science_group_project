Nancy Mona Carline (née Higgins, 30 November 1909 – 18 October 2004) was a British artist who painted landscapes with figures, portraits, biblical and classical subjects plus groups of figures in domestic settings. She studied at the Slade School of Art and worked at the Sadlers Wells Ballet and later attended the stage design course at the Slade run by Vladimir Polunin. In 1950 she married the artist Richard Carline, which placed her at the centre of an artistic circle centred on the Carline family in Hampstead.
