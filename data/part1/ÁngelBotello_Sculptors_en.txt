Ángel Botello (June 20, 1913 – November 11, 1986), full name Ángel Botello y Barros, was a Spanish-Puerto Rican painter, sculptor and graphic artist.  He was dubbed "The Caribbean Gauguin" for his use of bold colors and depictions of island life. Botello is considered one of the greatest Latin American post-modern artists and recognition and demand for his artwork continues to grow today, fetching unprecedented auction prices.
Ángel Botello never attached to any particular artistic school or movement and was a protean artist: he developed his own artistic style.  Botello was a versatile and many-sided artist who worked in all artistic media at his reach:  oil paintings, drawing, printmaking, bronze sculptures, wood carving, photography and mosaics.
