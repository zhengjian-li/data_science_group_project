Kevin Leyton-Brown (born May 12, 1975) is a Professor of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia.  He received his Ph.D. at Stanford University in 2003. He was the recipient of a 2014 NSERC E.W.R. Steacie Memorial Fellowship, a 2013/14 Killam Teaching Prize, and a 2013 Outstanding Young Computer Science Researcher Prize from the Canadian Association of Computer Science. 
Leyton-Brown co-teaches a popular game theory course on Coursera.org, along with Matthew O. Jackson and Yoav Shoham. Leyton-Brown serves as an associate editor for the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, the Artificial Intelligence journal, and ACM Transactions on Economics and Computation, and was program chair for the ACM Conference on Electronic Commerce in 2012.
Leyton-Brown and coauthors have received the IJCAI-JAIR Best Paper Prize and numerous medals in international SAT competitions (2003â€“12). He was elected an AAAI Fellow in 2018.
Leyton-Brown's research is at the intersection of computer science and microeconomics, addressing computational problems in economic contexts and incentive issues in multiagent systems. He also studies the application of machine learning to the automated design and analysis of algorithms for solving hard computational problems. In 2023, Leyton-Brown was named a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada.
