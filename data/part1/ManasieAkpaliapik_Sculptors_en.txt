Manasie Akpaliapik (born 1955) is a Canadian Inuk sculptor.  
Akpaliapik was born in a hunting camp on Baffin Island, Nunavut and moved with his family to Ikpiarjuk (Arctic Bay) in 1967. Though his parents were sculptors, he learned to carve at age ten by observing his grandparents. 
At age 12 he was sent to residential school in Iqaluit where his language and culture were suppressed. Akpaliapik left residential school at 16 years old. 
Akpaliapik married a woman named Noodloo and returned to Arctic Bay with his family. His wife and their two children were killed in a fire in 1980, after which Akpaliapik moved to Montreal and subsequently to Toronto.
