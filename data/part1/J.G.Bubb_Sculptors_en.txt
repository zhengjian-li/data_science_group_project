James George Bubb (1781â€“1853) was a prolific sculptor in marble and artificial stone of the early Victorian era who is now largely forgotten. His sculptures adorn buildings across the United Kingdom whilst his relief adorning the Italian Opera House in London was the largest undertaken in Great Britain at that time.
