Janine Antoni (born January 19, 1964) is a Bahamianâ€“born American artist, who creates contemporary work in performance art, sculpture, and photography. Antoni's work focuses on process and the transitions between the making and finished product, often portraying feminist ideals. She emphasizes the human body in her pieces, such as  her mouth, hair, eyelashes, and, through technological scanning, brain, using it as a tool of creation or as the subject of her pieces, exploring intimacy between the spectator and the artist. Her work blurs the distinction between performance art and sculpture.
She describes her work by saying "I am interested in extreme acts that pull you in, as unconventional as they may be"
She currently resides in Brooklyn, New York. Represented by Luhring Augustine Gallery, NY,  and Anthony Meier Fine Arts, San Francisco.
