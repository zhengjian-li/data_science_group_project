Douglas Bruce Lenat (September 13, 1950 â€“ August 31, 2023) was an American computer scientist and researcher in artificial intelligence who was the founder and CEO of Cycorp, Inc. in Austin, Texas.
Lenat was awarded the biannual IJCAI Computers and Thought Award in 1976 for creating the machine-learning program AM.  He has worked on (symbolic, not statistical) machine learning (with his AM and Eurisko programs),  knowledge representation, "cognitive economy", blackboard systems, and what he dubbed in 1984 "ontological engineering" (with his Cyc program at MCC and, since 1994, at Cycorp).  He has also worked in military simulations, and numerous projects for the US government, military, intelligence, and scientific organizations.  In 1980, he published a critique of conventional random-mutation Darwinism.  He authored a series of articles in the Journal of Artificial Intelligence exploring the nature of heuristic rules.
Lenat was one of the original Fellows of the AAAI, and is the only individual to have served on the Scientific Advisory Boards of both Microsoft and Apple.  He was a Fellow of the AAAS, AAAI, and Cognitive Science Society, and an editor of the J. Automated Reasoning, J. Learning Sciences, and J. Applied Ontology. He was one of the founders of TTI/Vanguard in 1991 and member of its advisory board Archived October 12, 2017, at the Wayback Machine.  He was named one of the Wired 25.
