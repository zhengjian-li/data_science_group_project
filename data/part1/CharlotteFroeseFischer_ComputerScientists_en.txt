Charlotte Froese Fischer (September 21, 1929 – February 8, 2024) was a Canadian-American applied mathematician, computer scientist and physicist noted for the development and implementation of the Multi-Configurational Hartree–Fock (MCHF) approach to atomic-structure calculations and its application to the description of atomic structure and spectra.
The experimental discovery of the negative ion of calcium 
was motivated by her theoretical prediction of its existence.
This was the first known anion of a Group 2 element. 
Its discovery was cited in Froese Fischer's election to Fellow of the American Physical Society.
