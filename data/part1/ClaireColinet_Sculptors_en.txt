Claire Jeanne Roberte Colinet (1885â€“1972) was a French sculptor of Belgian birth who worked during the early-to-mid 20th century.  The subject matter of her best known work was primarily Arab female dancers. The majority of her career output in sculpture can be classified as being of the Art Deco style.
Colinet was a frequent exhibitor at the Salon des Artistes Francais and Salon des Independents art exhibitions in Paris. Her sculptures, most of which depicted beautifully figured, energized, and dramatic female forms, were exhibited posthumously at the Paris Salon for nearly 30 years.
