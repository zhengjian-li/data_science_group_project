Herman Wilhelm Bissen (13 October 1798 – 10 March 1868) was a Danish sculptor. Bissen created a number of public works, working in plaster, marble and bronze. 
The National Gallery of Denmark owns a collection of over two hundred of his works, including over one hundred busts. Among his notable works are the monumental Landsoldaten (1858) in Fredericia, the statue of Adam Oehlenschläger (1854–61) in front of the Royal Danish Theatre in Copenhagen, and the equestrian statue of King Frederik VII of Denmark in front of Christiansborg Castle.
