Antonio Abondio (1538â€“1591) was an Italian sculptor, best known as a medallist and as the pioneer of the coloured wax relief portrait miniature.
Born in Riva del Garda, he was trained by Leone Leoni and worked in Italy between 1552 and 1565. Thereafter he mainly worked for the Habsburgs, with a few works made for French and Polish kings. He moved to Vienna to the court of Emperor Maximilian I and after his death in 1576 to Prague. He travelled to France, Netherlands and Germany.  He died at Vienna in 1591.
His son Alessandro followed in his father's footsteps, also specializing in mythological and portrait reliefs, and marrying the widow of another court artist, Hans von Aachen.
