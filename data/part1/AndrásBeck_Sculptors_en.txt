András Beck (1911–1985) was a Hungarian sculptor. He was noted for his
symbolic and expressionist bronze statuettes and portrait busts.
His 3.5-metre-tall statue commemorating the death of Jan Palach was transported from France to the Czech Republic to be installed in Mělník, the city of studies of Jan Palach, on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of his death.
