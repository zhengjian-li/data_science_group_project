Kevin Caron (born February 2, 1960, in Stratford, Connecticut) is a sculptor from Phoenix, Arizona. He has created more than 60 private and public commissioned works which are on display across the United States. Among his works are pieces on public display in Tucson, Arizona, Temple, Texas, Avondale, Arizona, Chandler, Arizona, Surprise, Arizona and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. He was chosen as Visual Artist of the Year in the 2018 Phoenix Mayor's Arts Awards, and his public art sculpture Hands On won 17th Annual Best of the West Arts & Culture Award for 2009.
Although he began his work as an artist working in fabricated steel, Caron is also a pioneer in using 3D printing to create large scale 3D printed sculpture, using an 8-foot-tall Cerberus 3D Gigante 3D printer that he had built for him. His largest 3D-printed sculpture to date is Debutante, a more than 6-foot-tall sculpture. A 5-1/2-foot-tall sculpture, Epic Swoon, was commissioned by PricewaterhouseCoopers in Columbus, Ohio.
