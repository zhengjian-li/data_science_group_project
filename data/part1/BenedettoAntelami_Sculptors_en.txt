Benedetto Antelami (c. 1150 â€“ c. 1230) was an Italian architect and sculptor of the Romanesque school, whose "sculptural style sprang from local north Italian traditions that can be traced back to late antiquity". He is chiefly known for three carved doorways and the allegorical figures and prophets that decorate the Parma Baptistery.
